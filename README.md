### Object Name  
**Payment (API: Payment__c)**

### Fields
| Field Label       | API Name            | Type                  | Required |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------|
| Payment Type      | Payment_Type__c     | Picklist (Service, Product, Other) | ✔️ |
| Amount            | Amount__c           | Currency(18,0)        | ✔️ |
| Due Date          | Due_Date__c         | Date                  | ✔️ |
| Notes             | Notes__c            | Long Text Area        | ❌ |
| Account           | Account__c          | Master-Detail(Account)| ✔️ |
| Payment Name      | Name                | Auto Number (PAY-{0000}) | ✔️ |

### Relationship Type  
**Master-Detail (Account → Payment)**  
**Reasoning:**
- Payments should not exist without an Account.  
- When an Account is deleted, related Payments must also be deleted.  
- Provides roll-up summary support.  
- Fits real financial data integrity expectations.
